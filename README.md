# EvilTwin-Airbase-ng
An Evil Twin attack involves creating a fake Wi-Fi access point that mimics a legitimate one. The goal is to trick users into connecting to the rogue access point, allowing attackers to intercept, manipulate, or monitor the victims' network traffic.

# Legal and Ethical Considerations
Evil Twin attacks are illegal without explicit authorization. This setup should only be used in controlled environments, such as penetration testing with written consent. Always adhere to local laws and ethical guidelines when performing network tests.
